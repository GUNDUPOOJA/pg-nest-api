## Building blocks of nest.js
- Modules: Used to organize the code,some Typescript files uses @Module decorator that provides the metadata, which nest uses to organize the application structure.
- Providers : They are also called services, used for the abstraction of complexity and logic. The providers are inserted into controllers or other providers.
- Controllers : Used for handling the requests and providing the appropriate responses.

## What is Typescript?

- TypeScript is used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno).
- TypeScript introduced a great deal of syntax taken from object-oriented programming, including but not limited to:
- interfaces,
- classes,
- enumerated types,
- generics,
- modules.
